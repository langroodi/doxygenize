# doxygenize
This is a GitHub Action to automatically generate [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl) code documentation and publish it to GitHub Pages. The generator only supports HTML format, and currently it cannot handle LaTeX outputs.

![Doxygenize Octocat](./image/doxygenize-octocat.png)

## Setup
- Generate a default Doxygen configuration file called `Doxyfile` (Special thanks to @MatiasLGonzalez for correcting me and also adding dot tool support);
- Disable the following option in the Doxygen configuration file:
```
GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
```
- `doxygen` is called from the root directory of your repository, so any path on your `Doxyfile` should be relative to this directory and NOT relative to directory where your `Doxyfile` is located, i.e. if you have a project set up like:
```
.
│     
├───src
│   ├───sourcefile1.c
│   └───sourcefile2.c
├───docs
└───doc
    └───Doxyfile
```
then your `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`, `HTML_OUTPUT` and `INPUT` variables (and any other path variable) should be set like
```
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./ # Relative path to root of your repository (e.g, ./)
INPUT                  = ./src # Relative path to root of your repository (e.g, ./src)
HTML_OUTPUT            = ./docs # Relative path to root of your repository
```
- Enable GitHub Pages branch (i.e., gh-pages) on your repository using [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site);
- Copy the Doxygen configuration file to root of your repository;
- Call `action/checkoutv2` in the workflow to clone the repository;
- Add following step to your respository workflow script:
```yaml
uses: langroodi/doxygenize@[version/tag/commit hash (i.e., v1)]
```
- In case of different:
  - Doxygen configuration file name and/or path;
  - HTML output folder;
  - GitHub Pages branch name;
  - GitHub Pages home directory which contains `index.html` file;
  - Using Doxygen Dark Mode (partially tested on Mozilla 96.0 (64-bit) for Ubuntu)
  
 please refer to the [Inputs](#inputs) section.
